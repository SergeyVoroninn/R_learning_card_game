# RL-learning in card game
## About R-learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning method in which an agent (a trained system) learns to make optimal decisions through interaction with the environment. Unlike other approaches, RL does not require pre-prepared data with correct answers or explicit structure in them. Instead, the agent receives feedback in the form of numerical rewards or penalties, adjusting his strategy in such a way as to get the maximum reward.
## Some components of the reinforcement learning method:
An agent is a learning program or system that makes decisions and adapts its behavior based on the feedback it receives.  
The environment is the space in which the system operates. It can be a physical world (for example, for robots) or a virtual simulation (such as a playground or a software model).  
An action is a choice that affects the state of the environment. For example, a robot may choose a direction to move, while a game character may make a specific move.  
The state is the current state of the environment, which is perceived by the program before it takes another action.  
## About Card game
Simulation of a card game for money. There are 26 red and 26 black cards in the 52-card deck. The player has a choice: watch the next one or open the next one and complete the game. If the face-up card is red, then the player wins.
## USAGE
* `python r_project.py` - run hand-mode card game with suggestings from trained agent. 
## Solution
* Output Q-policy(the score of each decision) printing in q_policy.txt after executing r_project
## Find Hyper parametrs
* In work. Not ended.
